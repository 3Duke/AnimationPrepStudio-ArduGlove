# AnimationPrepStudio-ArduGlove
Arduino/SteamVR motion capture gloves for AnimationPrepStudio. 

This contains the files for building and programming a DIY SteamVR tracker motion capture glove using an Arduino to read a Flex Sensor 4.5" (SEN-08606) for each finger.

The laser cutter files are included to make the flex sensor sleevs.

The 3D printer files are include to make the hand strap that holds the Vive tracker.

The Arduino files are used to program the Arduino so it can communicate with AnimationPrepStudio via a Com port.

Two Arduino examples are show, one is a wired simple serial example, the other is the nRF24L01 wireless example.
